            <li>Through out my high school years I dabbled in python a little bit in my
            free time.</li>
            <li>My senior year of high school I decided to take AP Computer
            Science. The course was taught in java.</li>
            <li>Because I enjoyed the class I decided to continue studying
            Computer Science at Chico State.</li>
          </ol>

      <div style="float: right; width: 40%">
        <h2>While at Chico</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>So far I have taken CSCI 111 and 211. Currently I am also enrolled
          in CSCI 311.</li>
          <li>I have to take Web Development because it is a graduation requirment.</li>
          <li>I am excited to take this course because it is so different from
          the previous programming classes that I have taken. While those mainly
        focused on object oriented programming, in this class you get to see results
      much quicker.</li>
